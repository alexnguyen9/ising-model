# The Ising Model with Python

The following python notebook simulates the Ising model in physics onto a Pandas dataframe that I did for a project in school.  It models quantum spins onto a square lattice represented by a dataframe.  We are focusing our attention to what happens whens the spin system around a critical temperature.
